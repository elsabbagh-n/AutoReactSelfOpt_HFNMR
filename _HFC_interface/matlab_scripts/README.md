In this paper, we introduce the concept of autonomous self-optimizing flow reactors guided by 
in-line high-field NMR spectroscopy. We designed an autonomous experimental setup, combining 
an automated flow reactor with a high-field NMR spectrometer and a feedback optimization algorithm.

For this, Matlab scripts and functions have been developed in order to control Bruker high-field spectrometer using wireless local-area network (WLAN).
The main function is "ExtSet_GUI_function".
