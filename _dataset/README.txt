In this paper, we introduce the concept of autonomous self-optimizing flow reactors guided by 
in-line high-field NMR spectroscopy. We designed an autonomous experimental setup, combining 
an automated flow reactor with a high-field NMR spectrometer and a feedback optimization algorithm.

For this, five different experiments were carried out:
(i)	1D 1H NMR spectra with a WET block for solvent suppression were acquired on samples of the 
	prepared stock solutions to identify peaks of the reagents and catalyst (see Figure S2 in ESI);
(ii)	Continuous 1D 1H NMR spectra with a WET block for solvent suppression  were acquired following
	the launch of two flow reaction runs to monitor the arrival of the mixture of interest in 
	NMR detection zone;
(iii)	1D 1H NMR spectra with a WET block for solvent suppression  were acquired to screen the reaction
	mixture of different flow reaction runs with different residence times
(iv)	1D 1H NMR spectra with a WET block for solvent suppression  were acquired to screen the reaction
	mixture of different flow reaction runs during the autonomous self-optimization to maximize 
	the yield and throughput
(v)	1D 1H and 13C NMR spectra acquired on sample of the purified product in MeOD in an NMR tube.
(vi)	1D 1H NMR spectra with a WET block for solvent suppression were acquired at high and low-field on
	the same reaction sample in an NMR tube.
(vii)	Result of the HRMS analysis on 1.48 g of the purified product.
